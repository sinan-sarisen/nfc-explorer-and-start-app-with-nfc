# NFC Explorer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/infertux/nfc-explorer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/infertux/nfc-explorer)

This is a very simple Android app to scan NFC tags/cards and extract as much information as possible from them.
The app is "read-only" and does not perform any write operations.

## Build

- Using Android Studio: select "Build APK" from the Build menu.
- Using Gradle: `JAVA_HOME=/opt/android-studio/jre ./gradlew build`

## Install

The APK file will be generated into `./app/build/outputs/apk/`.

## Disclaimer

This is my first Android app therefore don't use the source code as reference because I have no idea what I'm doing!
Besides, I hate Java.
However, improvement suggestions are welcomed :)
